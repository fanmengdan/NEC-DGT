**Code Description**

There are four experiment tasks: synthetic1, synthetic2, Molecule (reactaction prediction) and IoT malware confinement.
Each folder contrains the relevant python script: main.py, model.py and utlis.py, as well as the dataset.


For running each task, run the main.py by editing the FLAGS "--type" to "train" to train the model.

                                       by editing the FLAGS "--type" to "test" to test and use the trained model.
