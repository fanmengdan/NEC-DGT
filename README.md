This is the implementation and supplemental materials for paper "Deep Multi-attributed Graph Translation with Node-Edge Co-evolution"


There are four experiment tasks: synthetic1, synthetic2, Molecule (reactaction prediction) and IoT malware confinement.

Each folder contrains the relevant python script: main.py, model.py and utlis.py, as well as the dataset.

For running each task, run the main.py by editing the FLAGS "--type" to "train" to train the model.
                                       by editing the FLAGS "--type" to "test" to test and use the trained model.
